# javafx-mvc
This is an ultra lightweight mvc pattern framework for javafx.
It consists of three packages:

    1. javafx-mvc
    2. validation
    3. l10n
    
javafx-mvc contains the core functionality to implement he mvc pattern. The validation package gives some basic help for validate input. And the l10n package is useful for the internationalisation.
